# Fully Local RAG Using Phi3

Welcome to the "Fully Local RAG Using Phi3" repository! In this project, we explore the concept of **Region Adjacency Graphs (RAGs)** and leverage the power of the Phi3 model to create a fully local version for efficient image segmentation.

## Overview

Region Adjacency Graphs are a powerful tool for representing relationships between adjacent regions in an image. By combining them with the Phi3 model, we aim to achieve accurate and context-aware image segmentation.

## Features

- **Fully Local Approach**: Unlike traditional RAGs that consider global context, our approach focuses on local regions for improved efficiency.
- **Phi3 Integration**: We utilize the Phi3 model to extract rich features from image regions.
- **Segmentation**: The project includes code for segmenting images based on the RAGs.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imanoop7/fully-local-rag-using-phi3.git
   cd fully-local-rag-using-phi3
2. Install the required dependencies (see requirements.txt).
3. Explore the local-rag.ipynb and local-rag-colab.ipynb notebooks to       
   understand the implementation details.

## Usage
The notebooks provide step-by-step instructions on how to create and utilize fully local RAGs using the Phi3 model. Follow along to experiment with image segmentation.
